chess
=====

Another useless chess game in Python:
-  The masterplan is to get a fully functional chess game, with network functionality and a powerfull engine.
-  In the long run, I'm planning to add CUDA-acceleration for deep-tree searches. 
-  Also planning on forking this to work on distributed systems.

I'm overcommenting everything so I can use it to blog about in a later stage, as it's the ideal project to get comfortable
using OO.
